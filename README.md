# Learning Java

This repository is my personal workspace for learning Java through a structured course.
It includes lesson examples, coding exercises, and small challenges I complete as I progress.

## What's inside
- Lesson files that match topics from the course.
- Exercise files where I practice the concepts.
- A `CodexCode` folder that contains my guided practice versions of lessons/exercises.

## Notes
- File and class names are kept simple and match the lesson or exercise number/title.
- This repo is for learning and experimentation, so you may see incremental changes over time.

## Goal
Build a solid foundation in Java by practicing regularly and documenting progress through code.
